# Sudoku Helper

This is not (yet) a sudoku solver. But you can use it as a helper. Enter digits in the sudoku and it will help you reach the final solution.

## Installation

There is nothing to install. Clone the repo and open the [`index.html`](./index.html) file in a browser. All the functionality is coded in the html and js files and served locally so it doesn't even need internet to run.

## Usage

To enter numbers, click on the cell and enter the number at the prompt. Once you enter the number, all connected cells will remove that number from their their list of possible numbers. If a cell is left with a single possible number, the helper would automatically fill that up.

## Disclaimer

The helper would be able to solve most easy or medium level sudoku puzzles, but it would need some human intelligence for hard or expert level puzzle. I plan to update it soon(?)
